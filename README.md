# NESEmu
Emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) written by Jacob Paton.

This is the first emulator I've written and only has a few imperfections. There are several things on my todo list that I would like to tackle with this project. As I continue working on it, I'll update this README with the project status. I plan to clean up the main loop to be contained with a NES class to allow for the emulator to be used as a library for a suite of emulators (which I may or may not create in the future).
